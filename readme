rest parameter:-

...numbers called as spread operator
num as key value value it will change.
numbers is an array

let and const:- we can reassign the value of let but we cannot reassign the value of const
but we can change the value of const but we cannot reassign the value of const

syncronous and asyncronous:-
syncronous:- it will execute the code line by line,it will wait for the previous code to execute before executing the next code
asyncronous:- it will execute the code in any order,it will not wait for the previous code to execute

promise:- it is used to handle asyncronous code
ex:- promise has resolve and reject  resolve use for success and reject use for failure
asyncroous means:- it will execute the code in any order
so resolve with take time to execute and reject with take time to execute

it has three states:- loading, fulfilled, rejected

loading:- it is the initial state of the promise
fulfilled:- it is the state when the promise is resolved successfully
rejected:- it is the state when the promise is rejected
await:- it is used to wait for the promise to be resolved,
it give 1st preference to the promise to be resolved before executing the next code

fetch:- it is used to make an API call

set timeout:- it is used to execute a function after a certain time
set interval:- it is used to execute a function repeatedly after a certain time

marks and ...marks:-
marks:- it is used to store the remaining parameters in an array
...marks:- called as spread operator and it is used to spread the elements of an array or an object
destructuring:- it is used to extract values from an array or an object and assign them to variables
example:- let marks=[10,20,30]
let [m1,m2,m3]=marks
=>m1=10,m2=20,m3=30

spread operator:- it is used to spread the elements of an array or an object
example:- let marks=[10,20,30]  ...marks => 10,20,30
